# Aks Questions Make Decisions

## Week 1

### Structured thinking

Structured thinking is the process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options. In this process, address a vague, complex problem by breaking it down into smaller steps, and then those steps lead you to a logical solution.

### Sylabus

1. Asking effective questions: To do the job of a data analyst, you need to ask questions and problem-solve. In this part of the course, you’ll check out some common analysis problems and how analysts solve them. You’ll also learn about effective questioning techniques that can help guide your analysis.

2. Making data-driven decisions: In analytics, data drives decision making. In this part of the course, you’ll explore data of all kinds and its impact on decision making. You’ll also learn how to share your data through reports and dashboards.

3. Mastering spreadsheet basics: Spreadsheets are an important data analytics tool. In this part of the course, you’ll learn both why and how data analysts use spreadsheets in their work. You’ll also explore how structured thinking can help analysts better understand problems and come up with solutions. 

4. Always remembering the stakeholder: Successful data analysts learn to balance needs and expectations. In this part of the course, you’ll learn strategies for managing the expectations of stakeholders while establishing clear communication with your team to achieve your objectives.  

### Six data analysis phases

#### Step 1: Ask
It’s impossible to solve a problem if you don’t know what it is. These are some things to consider:

* Define the problem you’re trying to solve 
* Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations
* Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions
* Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication
* Take a step back and see the whole situation in context

Questions to ask yourself in this step: 
1. What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?
2. Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?

#### Step 2: Prepare

You will decide what data you need to collect in order to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it is useful. You might use your business task to decide: 

* What metrics to measure
* Locate data in your database
* Create security measures to protect that data

Questions to ask yourself in this step: 
1. What do I need to figure out how to solve this problem?
2. What research do I need to do?

#### Step 3: Process

Clean data is the best data and you will need to clean up your data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. This might mean:

* Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data 
* Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces
* Removing repeated entries
* Checking as much as possible for bias in the data

Questions to ask yourself in this step: 
1. What data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve?
2. How can I clean my data so the information I have is more consistent?

#### Step 4: Analyze 

You will want to think analytically about your data. At this stage, you might sort and format your data to make it easier to: 

* Perform calculations
* Combine data from multiple sources
* Create tables with your results

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
1. What story is my data telling me?
2. How will my data help me solve this problem?
3. Who needs my company’s product or service? What type of person is most likely to use it?

#### Step 5: Share

Everyone shares their results differently so be sure to summarize your results with clear and enticing visuals of your analysis using data viz tools like graphs or dashboards. This is your chance to show the stakeholders you have solved their problem and how you got there. Sharing will certainly help your team:  

* Make better decisions
* Make more informed decisions
* Lead to stronger outcomes
* Successfully communicate your findings

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
1. How can I make what I present to the stakeholders engaging and easy to understand?
2. What would help me understand this if I were the listener?

#### Step 6: Act
Now it’s time to act on your data. You will take everything you have learned from your data analysis and put it to use. This could mean providing your stakeholders with recommendations based on your findings so they can make data-driven decisions.

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
1. How can I use the feedback I received during the share phase (step 5) to actually meet the stakeholder’s needs and expectations?

These six steps can help you to break the data analysis process into smaller, manageable parts, which is called structured thinking. This process involves four basic activities:

* Recognizing the current problem or situation
* Organizing available information 
* Revealing gaps and opportunities
* Identifying your options

### Common problem types

1. Making predictions
2. Categorizing things
3. Spotting something unusual
4. Identifying themes
5. Discovering connections
6. Finding patterns

### SMART questions

* Specific: Specific questions are simple, significant and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas.  

* Measurable: Measurable questions can be quantified and assessed.

* Action-oriented: Action-oriented questions encourage change.

* Relevant: Relevant questions matter, are important and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve.

* Time-bound: Time-bound questions specify the time to be studied.

#### Things to avoid when asking questions
* Leading questions: questions that only have a particular response
  * Example: This product is too expensive, isn’t it?  
* Closed-ended questions: questions that ask for a one-word or brief response only
  * Example: Were you satisfied with the customer trial?
* Vague questions: questions that aren’t specific or don’t provide context
  * Example: Does the tool work for you?

### Working with Stakeholders

#### Working effectively with stakeholders

When you're working with each group of stakeholders- from the executive team, to the customer-facing team, to the data science team, you'll often have to go beyond the data. Use the following tips to communicate clearly, establish trust, and deliver your findings across groups.

1. Discuss goals. Stakeholder requests are often tied to a bigger project or goal. When they ask you for something, take the opportunity to learn more. Start a discussion. Ask about the kind of results the stakeholder wants. Sometimes, a quick chat about goals can help set expectations and plan the next steps.

2. Feel empowered to say “no.” Let’s say you are approached by a marketing director who has a “high-priority” project and needs data to back up their hypothesis. They ask you to produce the analysis and charts for a presentation by tomorrow morning. Maybe you realize their hypothesis isn’t fully formed and you have helpful ideas about a better way to approach the analysis. Or maybe you realize it will take more time and effort to perform the analysis than estimated. Whatever the case may be, don’t be afraid to push back when you need to. 

Stakeholders don’t always realize the time and effort that goes into collecting and analyzing data. They also might not know what they actually need. You can help stakeholders by asking about their goals and determining whether you can deliver what they need. If you can’t, have the confidence to say “no,” and provide a respectful explanation. If there’s an option that would be more helpful, point the stakeholder toward those resources. If you find that you need to prioritize other projects first, discuss what you can prioritize and when. When your stakeholders understand what needs to be done and what can be accomplished in a given timeline, they will usually be comfortable resetting their expectations. You should feel empowered to say no-- just remember to give context so others understand why. 

3. Plan for the unexpected. Before you start a project, make a list of potential roadblocks. Then, when you discuss project expectations and timelines with your stakeholders, give yourself some extra time for problem-solving at each stage of the process.

4. Know your project. Keep track of your discussions about the project over email or reports, and be ready to answer questions about how certain aspects are important for your organization. Get to know how your project connects to the rest of the company and get involved in providing the most insight possible. If you have a good understanding about why you are doing an analysis, it can help you connect your work with other goals and be more effective at solving larger problems. 

5. Start with words and visuals. It is common for data analysts and stakeholders to interpret things in different ways while assuming the other is on the same page. This illusion of agreement* has been historically identified as a cause of projects going back-and-forth a number of times before a direction is finally nailed down. To help avoid this, start with a description and a quick visual of what you are trying to convey. Stakeholders have many points of view and may prefer to absorb information in words or pictures. Work with them to make changes and improvements from there. The faster everyone agrees, the faster you can perform the first analysis to test the usefulness of the project, measure the feedback, learn from the data, and implement changes.

6. Communicate often. Your stakeholders will want regular updates on your projects. Share notes about project milestones, setbacks, and changes. Then use your notes to create a shareable report. Another great resource to use is a change-log, which you will learn more throughout the program. For now, just know that a change-log is a file containing a chronologically ordered list of modifications made to a project. Depending on the way you set it up, stakeholders can even pop in and view updates whenever they want.

### Focus on what matters

1. Who are the primary and secondary stakeholders?
  * Take time to identify who are they and what are their goals.

2. How is managing the data?
  * Find those who know better the data you will use.

3. Where can you go for help?

### Clear communication

Before communicate, think about:
1. Who your audience is
2. What they already know
3. What they need to know
4. How you can communicate that effectively to them
