## Week 1

### What makes knowledge scientific?


Non-Scientific methods

4. Casual observation
5. Informal logic

**Opinion <> Evidence**

Scientific methods
1. Systematic observation
2. Formal logic, consistently applied

### Principles of Scientific Methods
1. empirically testable
2. replicable: anyone must be able to replicate the study
3. objective: clear assumptions, concepts, procedures
4. transparent: replicated by anyone, publicly shared
5. falsifiable: there must be facts that contradict the hypothesis
6. logically consistent: no internal contradiction
