# Path to Data Science

The main ideia behind this repo is to organize material, code and notes from courses that will help me navigate through the several path possibilities of becoming a better data professional and eventually a data scientist.

The first big issue is **how to know what to know about?**

After a lot of readings, youtube videos, chatting with friends trying to walk this same path, I've surrendered myself trying to follow the perfect path, first because there is no such a path, and second because each one has his own backgroud, with his own objectives.

So after almost 2 years without any step in the path, here I am again. And now, I'll do different from the first time: I'm not sharing courses in advance, that I will eventually attend to. I'll share step by step, along the process.


## [Methods and Statistics in Social Sciences Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/social-science)

* Offered by: University of Amsterdam
* Description: Identify interesting questions, analyze data sets, and correctly interpret results to make solid, evidence-based decisions.
This Specialization covers research methods, design and statistical analysis for social science research questions. In the final Capstone Project, youâ€™ll apply the skills you learned by developing your own research question, gathering data, and analyzing and reporting on the results using statistical methods.
