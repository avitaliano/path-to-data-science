# Linear Algebra

### Magnitude

* Given any vector v = [v1, v2, v3, ..., vn]:
* Magnitude(v) = sqrt( v1^2 + v2^2 + v3^2 + ... + vn^2 )

### Parallel and Orthogonal Vectors

* v and w are parallel if one is a scalar multiple of the other.
* v is parallel to 2v, 1/2v

* v a w are orthogonal if v.w = 0

* zero vector
